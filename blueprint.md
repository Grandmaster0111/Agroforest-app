# Smart Irrigation App Blueprint

## Overview

The Smart Irrigation app is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to provide users with a smart and efficient way to manage their irrigation systems. The app connects to a Firebase backend to fetch real-time sensor data, provide weather forecasts, and allow users to control their irrigation system remotely.

## Features

*   **Real-time Sensor Data:** The app displays real-time data from various sensors, including soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.
*   **Water Tank Level:** The app shows the current water tank level and provides a visual representation of the tank's status.
*   **Weather Forecast:** The app fetches and displays the current weather forecast to help users make informed decisions about their irrigation schedule.
*   **Irrigation Control:** Users can manually control the irrigation valve or switch to an automatic mode that irrigates based on the soil moisture level and the selected crop.
*   **Crop-specific Advice:** The app provides irrigation advice based on the selected crop, ensuring that each plant receives the optimal amount of water.
*   **Analytics:** The app provides historical data and charts for soil moisture, irrigation cycles, and water tank levels, allowing users to track trends and optimize their irrigation strategy.
*   **Multi-language Support:** The app supports English, Hindi, and Nepali, making it accessible to a wider audience.

## Design

The app follows the Material Design guidelines, providing a clean and intuitive user interface. It uses a combination of cards, icons, and charts to present information in a clear and concise manner. The app is designed to be responsive and work seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

## Implementation

*   **Frontend:** The app is built using Flutter, a cross-platform framework for building mobile applications.
*   **Backend:** The app uses Firebase as its backend, leveraging Firestore for data storage and Firebase Messaging for push notifications.
*   **State Management:** The app uses the `provider` package for state management, allowing for a clear separation of concerns and a predictable data flow.
*   **Internationalization:** The app uses the `flutter_localizations` and `intl` packages to provide multi-language support.
*   **Charting:** The app uses the `fl_chart` package to display historical data in the form of charts.
